# displayctl
A handy utility to handle various works related to the display.
 
This script is written with the intention of **dealing with display resolution, brightness, wallpaper, and lockscreen using just a single utility**. You may apply several effects (e.g., blur, dim, or both...etc) to your wallpaper and lockscreen. It provides a caching mechanism to let you lock your screen faster.

The configuration of displayctl (like the path to your daily wallpaper, default display resolution, default screen brightness...etc) are stored in the X resource database, so that **these values can be managed within a single file**, instead of being scattered across numerous scripts/configs.

## What It Does 
* Set display resolution and brightness.
 
* Set desktop wallpaper / lockscreen with the following effects:
  * regular
  * blur
  * dim
  * blur + dim
  * blurry screenshot (for lockscreen only)
 
* Caching - to make lockscreen faster.
  * **displayctl uses the cache for lockscreen automatically (if exists)**
  * the cache is at /tmp/bg.png
  * use **displayctl --clear-cache** or simply **displayctl** if you want to apply new effects
 
* Now everything related to the display can be managed within a single file (~/.Xresources).
 
* Sometimes when I quit games like Skyrim, the resolution did not revert back correctly, and I have to run xrandr...
 
But now I only need to type
```
displayctl
```
and then the resolution will go back to the original.

* xbacklight   - Setting display brightness.
* xrdb         - Getting configuration from X server resource database.
 
 
 
## Manual Installation
### Getting the script.
 
either git clone this repo and take the script, or...
```
git clone https://github.com/aesophor/displayctl
```
 
download the script directly with wget.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aesophor/displayctl/master/displayctl
chmod +x displayctl
```
 
***
### Preparing configuration files.
 
copy displayctlrc to ~/.x
```
cp displayctlrc ~/.x/.
```
 
 
And we have to **include ~/.x/displayctlrc in .Xresources** (or .Xdefaults, which depends on your setting).
 
```
! displayctl configuration file
#include "/home/<username>/.x/displayctlrc"
```
 
It should look something like this...

![configs](/scrot/configs.png)

**[IMPORTANT]** Replace <username> with your own username.
 
Modify .displayctlrc according to your needs.
Use xrandr to find your display monitor and resolution.
 

***
### Reload .Xresources
 
Also you may need to reload your .Xresources. Type this in terminal.
```
xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
```
 
 
Finally, put .functions in your home directory. This file contains an important function to get your own configuration of displayctl from the X resource database.
Also make sure to include the following line in your .zshrc (or whatever shell config that you are using). This script needs it!
```
source ~/.functions
```

Then you may logout current X session, restart X, and enjoy!
 
## Usage
Some examples
* Set display resolution and wallpaper upon X server starts
If you aren't using any Display Manager like me, simply put the following line at the end of your i3 config. This will set both display resolution and wallpaper for you.
```
exec --no-startup-id /usr/bin/bash /path/to/displayctl
```
 
* Set wallpaper with both blur and dim effect.
```
displayctl -w --blur --dim
```
 
* Lockscreen with both blur and dim effect.
```
displayctl -l --blur --dim
```
 
* Lockscreen with blurry screenshot effect (Slower, since caching does not work well with this one.)
```
displayctl -l --scrot
```
 
* Clear previous cache. Clearing previous cache before applying new effects to your lockscreen.
```
displayctl --clear-cache
```

* See help message.
```
displayctl -h
```
 

## TODOS
- [x] separated desktop wallpaper and lockscreen wallpaper.
